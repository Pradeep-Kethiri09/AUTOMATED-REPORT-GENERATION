This project automates the generation of a PDF report summarizing student scores from a CSV file. It uses the pandas library to read and analyze data, calculating total students, average, highest, and lowest scores. The FPDF library is employed to create a formatted PDF report that includes a title, summary statistics, and a table of student names and scores. The main function orchestrates the workflow, making it easy to generate reports for educators.
